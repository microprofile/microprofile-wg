title: "MicroProfile Open API 3.1 (under development)"
date: 2022-06-28
summary: "Release for MicroProfile 6.0"
---
MicroProfile Open API aims to provide a set of Java interfaces and programming models which allow Java developers to natively produce OpenAPI v3 documents from their JAX-RS applications.

The goal of this release is to provide features requested by the community, such as:

=== API/SPI Changes

* Add `extensions` attribute to most annotations (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/issues/387[387])
* Improvements to the definition of security requirements (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/issues/483[483], https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/issues/468[468])
** Define behavior of `@SecurityRequirementsSet` and make it repeatable
** Clarify that a individual `@SecurityRequirement` annotation applied to a class or method is equivalent to a `@SecurityRequirementsSet` annotation containing that `@SecurityRequirement` annotation
** Add `securitySets` attribute to `@OpenAPIDefinition` and `@CallbackOperation`
* Add `additionalProperties` attribute to `@Schema` (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/issues/423[423])
* Allow `@APIResponse` to be applied to a class, indicating that every resource method on that class has that response (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/issues/417[417])

=== Other Changes

* Add processing of some Jakarta Bean Validation annotations (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/issues/482[482])
* Define the precedence of the `mp.openapi.scan.*` config properties (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/issues/422[422])
* Clarify that the `name` attribute of `@Extension` must include the `x-` prefix (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/issues/339[339])
* Only require that the `/openapi` endpoint is made available if there is documentation to show (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/issues/413[413])
* Recommend a standard endpoint for implementations which provide a user interface (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/issues/334[334])
* Recommend that implementations provide a way to serve CORS headers on the `/openapi` endpoint (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/issues/416[416])

The release won't contain any backwards incompatible changes.
