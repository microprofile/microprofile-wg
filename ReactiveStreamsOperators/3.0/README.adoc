title: "MicroProfile Reactive Streams Operators 3.0 (under development)"
date: 2022-07-28
summary: "Release for MicroProfile Reactive Streams Operators 3.0"
---
MicroProfile Reactive Streams Operators defines an API for manipulating Reactive Streams, providing operators such as map, filter, flatMap, 
in a similar fashion to the java.util.stream API introduced in Java 8. 
It also provides an SPI for implementing and providing custom Reactive Streams engines, allowing application developers to use whichever engine they see fit.
The goal of this release is to align with Jakarta EE 9.1:

=== API/SPI Changes

There are no functional changes introduced in this release, except updating the dependencies from javax to jakarta.

=== Other Changes

* TCK bug fix: loading ReactiveStreamsEngine and ReactiveStreamsFactory should also work running with a security manager (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-reactive-streams-operators/pull/170[#170])

=== Incompatible Changes
This release aligns with Jakarta EE 9.1, so it won't work with earlier versions of Jakarta or Java EE.
