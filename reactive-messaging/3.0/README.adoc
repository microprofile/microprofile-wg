date: 2022-08-01
summary: "Release for MicroProfile Reactive Messaging 3.0"
---
MicroProfile Reactive Messaging provides an architecture style to deliver responsive systems.
The goal of this release is to align with Jakarta EE 9.1:

==== Incompatible Changes
This release aligns with Jakarta EE 9.1 (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-reactive-messaging/issues/137[137]), so it won't work with earlier versions of Jakarta or Java EE.

==== API/SPI Changes
- Acknowledgement doesn't work with default Message.of(T,ack, nack)(link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-reactive-messaging/issues/143[#143])

=== Other Changes
- Wrong assertion in ThrowExceptionOverflowStrategyOverflowTest (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-reactive-messaging/issues/145[#145])
- DefaultOverflowStrategyOverflowTest expects downstream error (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-reactive-messaging/issues/147[#147])
- AsynchronousPayloadProcessorAckTest expects stream to continue after nack (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-reactive-messaging/issues/148[#148])
- Make the TCK tests CDI 4 compatible (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-reactive-messaging/issues/151[#151])
