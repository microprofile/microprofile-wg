# MicroProfile TCK Process 1.0

Specification Teams under the Eclipse Foundation Specification
Process MUST produce a Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) that delivers
on the promise of enabling multiple compatible implementations.

This document defines:

-   Materials a TCK MUST possess to be considered suitable for
    delivering portability

-   Process for challenging tests and how these challenges are resolved

-   Means of excluding released TCK tests from certification
    requirements

-   Policy on improving TCK tests for released specifications

-   Process for self-certification

[#_materials_for_a_tck_release]
## Materials for a TCK Release

Artifacts:

-   Specification contributors MUST produce the team licensed (EPL, Apache, etc.)
    version for distribution to Maven Central or other open source
    channels, usable for automated, non-official testing, and
    implementation. No compatibility claims can be made on the basis of
    this TCK.

-   Specification contributors MUST produce a final candidate binary that includes the
    (link:https://www.eclipse.org/legal/tck.php[EFTL]) license. The MicroProfile
    Specification Committee will sign and promote the Specification's TCK binary
    for distribution via Eclipse infrastructure on final approval. This
    is the TCK binary usable for self-certification when one desires to
    make a claim of compatibility.

-   Both TCK binaries MUST contain the following

    -   A top-level README document outlining

        *   Software requirements

        *   Installation and configuration

        *   How to run the tests

        *   Where to file challenges

        *   TCK specific rules not covered in this process guide

-   We recommend that the TCK documentation include

    *   URLs for the issue trackers to file certification requests, bug
        reports, etc.

    *   A statement that the anchor:_certification_of_compatibility[Certification of
        Compatibility] process must be
        followed before a claim of compatibility can be made.

-   TCK binaries MAY contain

    *   Test coverage document

    *   Test assertion document

-   Release available via a release on specification's GitHub project releases page(or
    equivalent)

    *   Final releases under the EFTL MUST be hosted on
        http://download.eclipse.org[download.eclipse.org]

[#_ratifying_a_final_tck]
### Ratifying a Final TCK

-   Specifications will submit the EFTL proposed final binary of the TCK for
    approval to the Specification Committee.

-   The Specification Committee will vote to approve or reject the TCK
    binary.

-   Approved binaries will be signed with the GPG key of the MicroProfile
    Specification Committee, and then published on download.eclipse.org
    along with the digital signature of the SHA-256 hash of the final
    binary, and the SHA-256 hash of the binary as the fingerprint of the
    TCK.

-   Consumers can use the GPG key of the MicroProfile Specification Committee
    to verify the authenticity of that or any TCK binary.

[#_challenges]
## Challenges

Specifications are the sole source of truth and considered overruling to
the TCK in all senses. In the course of implementing a specification and
attempting to pass the TCK, implementations may come to the conclusion
that one or more tests or assertions do not conform to the
specification, and therefore MUST be excluded from the certification
requirements.

Requests for tests to be excluded are referred to as Challenges. This
section identifies who can make challenges to the TCK, what challenges
to the TCK may be submitted, how these challenges are submitted, how and
to whom challenges are addressed.

[#_who_can_file_a_challenge]
### Who can file a challenge?

Any implementor may submit a challenge to one or more tests in the TCK
as it relates to their implementation. Implementor means the entity as a
whole in charge of producing the final certified release. **Challenges
filed MUST represent the consensus of that entity.**

[#_valid_challenges]
### Valid Challenges

Any test case (e.g., test class, \@Test method), test case configuration
(e.g., deployment descriptor), test beans, annotations, and other
resources considered part of the TCK may be challenged.

The following scenarios are considered in scope for test challenges:

-   Claims that a test assertion conflicts with the specification.

-   Claims that a test asserts requirements over and above that of the
    specification.

-   Claims that an assertion of the specification is not sufficiently
    implementable.

-   Claims that a test is not portable or depends on a particular
    implementation.

[#_invalid_challenges]
### Invalid Challenges

The following scenarios are considered out of scope for test challenges
and will be immediately closed if filed:

-   Challenging an implementation's claim of passing a test.
    Certification is an honor system and these issues MUST be raised
    directly with the implementation.

-   Challenging the usefulness of a specification requirement. The
    challenge process cannot be used to bypass the specification process
    and raise in question the need or relevance of a specification
    requirement.

-   Claims the TCK is inadequate or missing assertions required by the
    specification. See the Improvement section, which is outside the
    scope of test challenges.

-   Challenges that do not represent a consensus of the implementing
    community will be closed. If agreement is later reached by the
    implementing community, the issue can be reopened. The test
    challenge process is not the place for implementations to initiate
    their own internal discussions.

-   Challenges to tests that are already excluded for any reason.

-   Challenges that an excluded test should not have been excluded and
    SHOULD be re-added MUST be opened as a new enhancement request

[#_filing_a_challenge]
### Filing a Challenge

Challenges MUST be filed via the specification's Github issue tracker
using the label `challenge` and include the following information:

-   The relevant specification version and section number(s)

-   The coordinates of the challenged test(s)

-   The exact TCK version

-   The implementation being tested, including name and company

-   A full description of why the test is invalid and what the correct
    behavior is believed to be

-   Any supporting material; debug logs, test output, test logs, run
    scripts, etc.

#_challenge_resolution
### Challenge Resolution

Challenges can be resolved after a consensus of the specification
contributors is reached or attempts to gain consensus fails. Specification
contributors may exercise lazy consensus, voting or any practice that
follows the principles of https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/[Eclipse Foundation Development
Process].

[#_active_resolution]
#### Active Resolution

The failure to resolve a Challenge might prevent an implementation from
going to market; Challenges SHOULD be given a high priority by the
specification contributors and resolved in a timely manner. Two weeks or less
SHOULD be considered the ideal period of time to resolve a challenge.
Challenges may go longer as needed, but as a rule SHOULD avoid months.

If consensus cannot be reached by the specification contributors for a
prolonged period of time, the default recommendation is to exclude the
tests and address the dispute in a future revision of the specification.

[#_accepted_challenges]
#### Accepted Challenges

A consensus that a test produces invalid results will result in the
exclusion of that test from certification requirements, and an immediate
update and release of an official distribution of the TCK including the
new exclude list. The associated `challenge` issue MUST be closed with
an `accepted` label to indicate it has been resolved.

[#_rejected_challenges_and_remedy]
#### Rejected Challenges and Remedy

When a `challenge` issue is rejected, it MUST be closed with a label of
`invalid` to indicate it has been rejected. The appeal process for
challenges rejected on technical terms is outlined in Escalation Appeal.
If, however, an implementer feels the TCK challenge process was not
followed, an appeal issue MUST be filed with the specification's
issue tracker using the label `challenge-appeal`. A contributor MUST
escalate the issue with the MicroProfile Specification Committee via email
(<microprofile-wg@eclipse.org>). The committee will evaluate the matter
purely in terms of due process. If the appeal is accepted, the original
TCK challenge issue will be reopened and a label of `appealed-challenge`
added, along with a discussion of the appeal decision, and the
`challenge-appeal` issue will be closed. If the appeal is rejected, the
`challenge-appeal` issue MUST be closed with a label of `invalid`.

[#_excludes]
## Excludes

Excludes MUST be included in the specification's TCK release in a format that is
compatible with the testing framework in use so that as the excludes are
updated, the affected tests are automatically removed from the test
suite.

[#_improvement]
## Improvement

Requests for improvement to tests MUST simply be created as issues with
a label of `enhancement` in the specification's TCK issue
tracker.

[#_certification_of_compatibility]
## Certification of Compatibility

MicroProfile is a self-certification ecosystem. If you wish to have your
implementation listed on the official (link:https://microprofile.io[microprofile.io])
implementations page for the given specification, a certification
request as defined in this section is required.


[#_filing_a_certification_request]
### Filing a Certification Request

Requests to be acknowledged as a certified implementation for umbrella releases MUST be filed
under the github repo (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile[microprofile]) via the specification's issue tracker using the label
`certification`. Alternatively, if a certified implementation wants to only certify a particular specification release, the request
must be filed under the corresponding github repo such as (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance[Fault Tolerance]) for certifying a particular release of MicroProfile Fault Tolerance. 
The request must include the following information:

-   Statement of Acceptance of the terms of the EFTL

-   Product Name, Version and download URL (if applicable)

-   Specification Name, Version and download URL

-   TCK Version, digital SHA-256 fingerprint and download URL

-   Implementation runtime Version(s) tested

-   Public URL of TCK Results Summary

-   Any Additional Specification Certification Requirements

-   Java runtime used to run the implementation

-   Summary of the information for the certification environment,
    operating system, cloud, ...​

-   A statement attesting that all TCK requirements have been met,
    including any compatibility rules

[#_additional_specification_certification_requirements]
### Additional Specification Certification Requirements

Specifications may require additional items for a Certification
Request as defined in their corresponding TCK Documentation under the
section labeled \"Additional Certification Requirements\".

Examples of such additional requirements may include:

-   Name and version of Compatible Implementation used for
    interoperability tests

-   Name and version of Databases used for persistence tests

-   Name and version of NoSQL implementations used in persistence tests

[#_public_tck_results_summary]
### Public TCK Results Summary

While certification is on your honor, the community MUST be able to see
your test results summary. At a minimum a results summary MUST:

-   Be publicly visible with no password protection or sign-up

-   Include a Summary Page containing:

    *   All information in the above Certification Request

    *   The Total number of tests run and passed. 

An optional "Test List Page" showing all tests run may be linked from
the Summary Page. The Summary Page URL is the URL that MUST be included
in any Certification Requests.

The following are explicitly not requirements:

-   The Ability for the public to run the tests themselves

-   Full log output of the TCK

Implementors may supply this information and provide support for how to
run a TCK against their implementation, but it is not required.

[#_certification_resolution]
### Certification Resolution

Approval that the TCK requirements have been met is a prerequisite for getting
the corresponding runtime listed as a complible implementation of a particular MicroProfile platform release. 
The required approval processes is:

-   Approval by lazy consensus after a period of two weeks (14 days) or

-   Approval by at least two of the MicroProfile committers as soon as
it happens. The committers should not work for the same company where the certification requester is associated with.

All specification contributors are encouraged to review the request
and associated supporting materials. Reviewers of a certification
request MUST carefully check the validity of all required data, in
particular:

-   the data is complete

-   the number of tests passed is consistent with the first
    implementation used to validate the TCK

-   TCK version and digital fingerprint match.

-   test results are public and do not require special signup or viewing
    steps

Any committer on the specification may vote against the
certification request on the basis that the clearly defined requirements
of the TCK process have not been met. This means that if there is a (-1)
vote, lazy consensus is no longer an option and a majority vote MUST
take place.

[#_accepted_certification_requests]
#### Accepted Certification Requests

Certification requests that are reviewed and found to meet the
requirements will be marked accepted by closing an issue with an
`accepted` label. A pointer/link to the issue MUST then be emailed to
mailto:tck@eclipse.org[tck@eclipse.org] by the certification requestor, as required by the
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/tck.php[Eclipse Foundation Technology Compatibility Kit License]. 

[#_rejected_certification_requests]
#### Rejected Certification Requests

Certification requests that are reviewed and found to NOT meet the
requirements will be marked as such by closing an issue with an
`invalid` label along with the requirements that were not met. A new
certification issue MUST be created with the updated requirements to
attempt the certification request again.

[#_escalation_appeal]
### Escalation Appeal

If there is a concern that a TCK process issue has not been resolved
satisfactorily, the Eclipse Development Process https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/#6_5_Grievance_Handling[Grievance Handling]
procedure SHOULD be followed to escalate the resolution. Note that this
is not a mechanism to attempt to handle implementation specific issues.

[#_how_tests_may_be_added_to_a_tck]
### How Tests May be Added to a TCK

The only time tests may be added to a TCK are in a major or minor
release. A service release which updates the exclude list MUST not have
test additions, but may have test changes.
